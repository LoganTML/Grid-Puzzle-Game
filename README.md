# Grid-Puzzle-Game
 
After finishing an assignment for CSC 115 in which I created a program that navigated, on its own, through a maze using recursion at UVic, I decided that the concept of a game played through the command line on a grid would be interesting and fun to create.
Using only the original concept for converting a grid from a text file to a two dimensional array, I implemented a variety of classes, each with a variety of methods, to allow the user to input commands, either an individual or a string, to navigate through a puzzle.
Concepts used include File I/O, recursion, data structures such as stacks and queues, user input, and abstraction.
